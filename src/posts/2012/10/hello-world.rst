This is the first post of many. I will start this blog with a classic:

.. code-block:: python

    def say_hello():
        print("Hello world!")

    if __name__ == "__main__":
        say_hello()


This blog will have one theme in mind: **Technology**. If I am more specific: 
GNU/Linux, programming and scalability. 

The blog is made with `Pelican <http://blog.getpelican.com/>`_ and `gh-pages <https://help.github.com/categories/20/articles/>`_. The question maybe is *Why I want this blog to be static?* Well I will resume this in a list:

- Simple (I like simple things: `Python <http://www.python.org/>`_, `Slackware <http://www.slackware.com/>`_...)
- Scalable (all is static!)
- Posts in `reStructuredText <http://docutils.sourceforge.net/rst.html>`_ and/or `markdown <http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/>`_ syntax (This can be ported easily in the future)
- Github pages FTW!
- Pelican is awesome (`Jekyll <http://jekyllrb.com/>`_ too, but I prefer python to ruby)
- Is fun  and geeky :)

I think that I made my point. **See you soon with a techie and geeky post**
